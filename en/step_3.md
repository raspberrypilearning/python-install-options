## Dedicated Python editor

A dedicated Python editor is a single application where you can write, debug and run your programs. 

Python, the IDE, and any required software is bundled into a single installation which must be installed on your computer (Windows, macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi). 

Programs will typically run quicker than using online IDEs. You can also use an installed Python editor when offline. They normally include support for checking and debugging code as well as features for installing additional packages.

While they support the majority of programmers requirements, some advanced features may not be supported by these IDEs.

**Advantages**

+ Simplified user interface
+ Support for most programmers needs
+ Increased performance
+ Support for debugging tools

**Disadvantages**

+ Some features may not be supported
+ Your code can only be accessed on this device

*Dedicated Python editors are useful for programmers who can install software on their computer, want a simple but powerful interface and don't require advanced features.*
