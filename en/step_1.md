## Introduction

To create Python programs, you need a text editor to write your code, and a Python interpreter, which executes your code.

An editor, interpreter, and other useful tools (e.g. a file browser) are often bundled together into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs make creating programs much easier.

The IDE you use could either be online, on a website such as [repl.it](https://repl.it), or it could be installed on your computer.

This guide compares three types of IDE to help you choose the solution that is best for you:

1. [Online IDEs](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/python-install-options/1) - websites that let you create and run your code in a browser
1. [Dedicated Python editor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/python-install-options/2) - a single-purpose Python IDE installed on your computer 
1. [Full Python install](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/python-install-options/3) - a full Python installation on your computer, plus an installed stand-alone IDE

### Comparison of IDEs

|   | Online IDEs | Dedicated Python editor | Full Python install |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Requires installation** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Available offline** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Useful for** | Learners who are unable to install software | People who don't always have access to the internet | Advanced programmers or people who wish to use advanced features |
| **Experience level** | Learner| Learner, intermediate | Intermediate, advanced |
| **Examples** | [repl.it](https://repl.it) <br /> [trinket.io](https://trinket.io) | [Mu](https://codewith.mu) <br /> [Thonny](https://thonny.org) | [python.org](https://python.org) <br /> [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<br /> [Atom](https://atom.io/) |
