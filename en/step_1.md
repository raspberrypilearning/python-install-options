## Introduction

To create Python programs you need a text editor to write your code and a Python interpreter which takes your code and runs it.

An editor, interpreter and other useful tools (such as a file browser) are often bundled together into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which makes the process of creating programs much easier.

The IDE you use could be a website such as repl.it or a Python application installed on your computer.

This guide compares 3 different types of IDE and provides information to help you make a decision about what solution is best for you:

+ [Online](1) - websites where you can create and run your code in a browser
+ [Dedicated Python editor](2) - a single purpose Python IDE installed on your computer 
+ [Full Python install](3) - a full Python installation on your computer with an optional "standalone" IDE
