## Introduction

To create and run Python programs you will need to use a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

The IDE you use could be a website such as repl.it or a Python application installed on your computer.

This guide compares 3 different types of IDE and provides information to help you make a decision about what solution is best for you:
Online - websites where you can create and run your code in a browser
Installed Python editor - a single purpose Python IDE installed on your computer 
Full Python install - a full Python installation on your computer with an optional "standalone" IDE
