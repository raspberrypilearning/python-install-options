## Full Python install

A full installation of Python and an additional IDE is the right setup for expert users and those who wish to explore advanced features or libraries.

Installing Python on your computer will mean you have support for all features and the highly flexible setup will give you support for all use cases.

The setup is more complicated than a dedicated Python IDE and may need additional configuration to cater for your needs.

The IDLE editor, which comes installed with Python, has a two-window layout that can be confusing (particularly for those new to Python).

This solution does give you options to use an additional IDE alongside Python. These IDEs often come with advanced features for managing source code, debugging and different programming languages. 

**Advantages**

+ Highly flexible
+ Support for all features

**Disadvantages**

+ The IDLE editor pre-installed with Python can be confusing for new learners
+ More complex setup - using an additional IDE will require additional setup
+ The additional functions and features can be very confusing

The full Python installation can be downloaded from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
